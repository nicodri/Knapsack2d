For example we could store F as a \"triangular\" matrix (actually F is not square but we could have a triangular version for the submatrix F(min(W,H), min(W,H)). This will divide by 2 the iterations. This is not as easy as expected as the updates along the axis y and x in the inner loop may use cells from both side, so we have to include many if statements to be sure to stay in the right triangular part. \n",

The main issue is here that the set of different stages in the step 3 of the algorithm (one stage is combining the solution of two subproblems to solve a bigger one) is now much larger. This is due to the concatenation of rectangles which will form only on marginal case a rectangle with integer dimension. The questions raised here are: How to process these new multiple stages? How to increase the dimension of F as the integer one may not be relevant anymore?\n",
    "\n",
    "We could also improve the memory storage. For example, the arrangement dictionary actually contains the information of the matrix F (we just need to sum the values of each rectangle for one arrangement to get the corresponding F value). Both are kept for computation time optimization, but it's the memory is an issue we can remove it. Also, we could look for a reconstruction algorithm given the F matrix. This is a classical approach in dynamic programming: given the set of subproblems soved, we can construct the path leading to the global solution. We won't need to store the arrangement dictionnary if this is possible (or maybe a lower version).\n",
